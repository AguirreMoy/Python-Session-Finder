Open multiple windows to aid in passing queues

Will open as many unique chrome sessions by launching a new chrome window with a "target profile". Will use Default profiles if no user profiles already made in chrome directory.

After launching windows I suggest right clicking on the taskbar and selecting "Show windows side by side"
